<p> This was my first project for PLTW 1.1.9. My team and I had to create a drawing and move it around the screen using loops and conditional statements. We decided to make this rocket that flew around the screen and eventually flew off. Originally we wanted the rocket to split into two differnt parts but after days of testing we could not successfully get that idea to work, which led us to just have it move around as a whole </p>

<p> This was my second project, in which my team and I were tasked to make a game. We made a game where the user has to cross the rode without hitting the square cars and reach the green goal to get a point. The user has to wait until the timer reads 30 to start. </p>

<p> This was my third project, in which my team had to make another game. We tried to make a chrome dino type game, but due to lack of contribution from some members and getting stuck at certain points, are game was a little unfinished. We didn't get the backgrounds off the images and when the dino jumped, everything froze. I wish I would have been able to finish the game completely, but I believe I gave it my best shot with the given circumstances. </p>

<p> My fourth project was to create something on Scratch, so my group chose to make an interactive story about Christmas where the user can either save Christmas by throwing snowballs at the Grinch or let the Grinch ruin it by doing nothing. I beleive are project was a sucess, largely due to my teammate Anna who did most of the Scratch coding. </p>

<p> My fifth project was a solo project for College Board where I made a version of Space Invaders using the Python Turtle commands. This project turned out a success as the game fuctioned exactly as I intended for it to. </p>
