<p> This was my first project for PLTW 1.1.9. My team and I had to create a drawing and move it around the screen using loops and conditional statements. We decided to make this rocket that flew around the screen and eventually flew off. Originally we wanted the rocket to split into two differnt parts but after days of testing we could not successfully get that idea to work, which led us to just have it move around as a whole </p>

<p> This was my second project, in which my team and I were tasked to make a game. We made a game where the user has to cross the rode without hitting the square cars and reach the green goal to get a point. The user has to wait until the timer reads 30 to start. </p>
