	<p> This was my first project for PLTW 1.1.9. My team and I had to create a drawing and move it around the screen using loops and conditional statements. We decided to make this rocket that flew around the screen and eventually flew off. Originally we wanted the rocket to split into two differnt parts but after days of testing we could not successfully get that idea to work, which led us to just have it move around as a whole </p>
